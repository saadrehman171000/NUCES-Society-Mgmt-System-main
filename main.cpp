    ● Account registry
    ● Information Regarding Events (Past, Ongoing and Future)
    ● Duration of Events

To be done later:
    ● Allocation of accessibility to different accounts (example, Personal accounts can be updated
        by the people personally, Society head can update info regarding their society, etc.)
    ● Calendar (to display important dates)
    ● Notifications (to notify users about upcoming events and deadlines.)
    ● Registration process for students to apply for society’s membership.
    ● Evaluation of the applicants on the basis of information provided by applicants (It will help
        faculty/Society managers in considering who should be the best candidate)
